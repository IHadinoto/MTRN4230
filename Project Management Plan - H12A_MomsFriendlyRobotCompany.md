# Project Management Plan

## Project Title

Detection and Arrangement of User-Defined Alphanumeric Character Pieces.

## Project Scope

The aim of the project is to implement a program for the E-Series Robot Arm, that is capable of arranging characters according to the user's input. The user will input the character string into the program. Images of the characters will be printed onto physical, wooden blocks, which will be placed in front of the robot's camera. The robot will identify and arrange the wooden blocks corresponding to the inputted string, positioning them with the gripper TCP.

The characters will be strictly alphanumeric. Furthermore, the font of the characters and the shape of the wooden blocks will also be consistent. These restrictions were placed such that the project could be more feasibly accomplished with the provided resources and timeframe. As such, the project serves as a proof of concept, in which it can be extended to accomplish more complex detection, positioning, or sorting tasks. Examples include the manufacturing of vehicles, electrical components, and the production of foods.

## Milestone and Deliverables List

The table below displays the major milestones and deliverables for this project. The table will evolve as more information about the assessment is released, becoming more descriptive every iteration.

## Change Management Plan

Potential changes to be made to aspects of the project will
be handled via a Change Control Board (CCB). The following steps will detail the process that will be undertaken to process a change.
1. The requestor of the change should lodge their request with the project manager. It should be noted anyone can lodge a change request.
2. The project manager will note down any change requests in a file.
3. The project manager, team members and the requestor will evaluate the impact of the change on the cost, risk, schedule and scope.
4. The project manager will submit the change request along with the evaluation to the CCB for review.
5. The CCB will review the proposed change along with the provided information and decide on whether or not the change will be approved.
6. If the change is approved the project manager will update the project documentation as necessary and inform the team and stakeholders about the change.

This method will provide the flexibility for all members of the project to propose potential changes as well as the opportunity to have a say in what changes should be approved and denied. The Project Sponsor will chair the CCB and all changes must receive their approval if they are to be implemented.

As it stands, the company is in its early stages and so a CCB may not be properly established. Thus, rather than fully adopting the CCB, 
steps 4 and 5 will be replaced with a team vote with the project manager
breaking any ties.

## Scope Management Plan

Management of the scope will be the exclusive responsibility of the project manager.
The scope of this project is defined by the Project Scope Statement and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The project manager,
sponsor and stakeholders will need to formulate documentation that can be used to measure the project scope. This documentation
must include methods to evaluate the impact the scope change will have on the cost, risk and schedule. Deliverable quality checklists
and work performance measurements should also be included in this documentation.

Anyone involved with the project may lodge a scope change request with the project manager.
The project manager will evaluate the scope change request using the metrics detailed within the documentation
referenced earlier in the Scope Management Plan. Upon acceptance of the scope change, the project manager will
submit the request for evaluation by the CCB and project sponsor. Should the scope change
be accepted, it is the responsibility of the project manager to update all documentation and communicate the change in scope
to all stakeholders. Finally, the project sponsor is responsible for the acceptance of changes made to deliverables and the project scope
by the project manager and stakeholders.

The project sponsor is responsible for formally accepting the final deliverable of the project. This acceptance should be based on a
review of the documentation, all test and trial data, the expected completion of all tasks and the functionality of the final product.

As referenced in the Change Management Plan, given the early stages of the company, a CCB may not be properly established.
Thus, a team vote with the project manager having the final say will be taken in the event of any scope change requests.

## Schedule Management Plan

Schedule management plans are crucial, in ensuring a monitored and controlled project schedule, and thus the smooth progression of the project. The plan comprises various elements, such as defining a clear WBS, an outline of the roles and responsibilities of each group member, as well as the start and end date of the activities. They also establish project baselines, milestones, and deliverables. There are various methods in approaching schedule management plans. Such methods include using the waterfall project management method, the critical path method (CPM), the Scrum board, and the Kanban board. The optimality of each method is highly dependent on the size of the project, timeframe, and available resources.

Among the aforementioned methods, the Kanban board stands out, in that it allows its users to easily create, delegate, categorise, visualise, and navigate through tasks. The Kanban board has also been implemented in Github, via the 'Project Boards' feature. The members of the group have already planned to use Github to organise their code for this project. Centralising the managerial components of the project into a single application, will encourage the consistent usage of the Kanban method. Combined with its ease of use, this scheduling method will improve work efficiency, productivity, and collaboration.  Although Kanban does not offer a specific time frame associated with each task, this will not pose an issue as the group is relatively small. For these reasons, the group decided to utilise the Kanban board to manage the project's schedule.

During the weekly online and physical meetings, each group member will discuss their progress on their allocated tasks, issues that they may have come across, as well as provide feedback to each other. These discussions can also provide an opportunity for the reallocation of tasks, such to prevent any hindrances to the project timeline. Significant information from these discussions can then be recorded on the Kanban board, whereby group members can refer back to it after the meetings. This rigid schedule management plan accompanied with the Kanban board, will ensure that the project will be completed smoothly and successfully.

### Work Breakdown Structure
The image below illustrates the tasks and substasks in the form of flowchart. The project is divided into 5 main tasks, and each main task contains different number of subtasks identified accordingly.

### Resources
This section will detail the resources that are required for each of the tasks outlined in the WBS. In order to calculate the cost of each task,
the average salary of each of the positions was obtained before adding a 50% company overhead to the salaries. Dividing these modified salaries by 1820
yielded the hourly rate of each position. The number of employees that would occupy each position and take part in each task was then assigned. Multiplying
the duration, obtained from the Baseline Schedule, by the number of employees and the hourly rate of each position gives the cost of each task in terms of employee hours. The following table summarises this information along with the total cost due to employee hours.
|Task Number|        Task Name        |    Assigned To    |Duration (hours)|Number of Employees|   Cost   |

|           |                         |                   |                |     Total Cost    |$59,065.76|

In addition to the cost due to employee work hours, other costs due to utilities, office supplies and building rent will need to be considered for the final
budget of the company. An estimate of approximately $20,000 can be used to account for these expenses thus bringing the project budget to approximately $80,000.

Aside from money, other resources that are required to successfully carry out this project are necessary. These include the use of ROS, the main interface through which our program will
interface with the UR5 robot arm, as well as RViz to be able to simulate the arms behaviour. Blocks or pieces of paper with letters on them will also be needed to test the practical functionality of the software. These two pieces of software are open source and the letters can be hand so no additional cost is incurred. The requirement of a UR5 robot arm and webcam are necessary for physical testing of the software and so will incur costs. The UR5 robot arm will cost approximately $46,000 and the webcam around $100 to ensure sufficient image resolution and clarity for computer vision software. This means the project budget is finalised at approximately $126,000.
## Quality Management Plan

The following outlines the quality management plan employed for the project.

1. Quality checks have to be carried out regularly once every week by the group leader in order to ensure that the deliverables are of acceptable quality. Independent technical review and verification of the programming and individual programming components should be done to make sure that every member of the group has a standardised basis for the level of complexity and quality of the required coding work.

2. Every task that has been completed by each member and submitted using pull requests should also be verified by others to ensure that the quality objectives are met consistently with the required milestones and deliverables list. This allows for members to ask questions about other group member’s allocated parts in order to consistently move forward in the project’s progress.

3. If any of the group member’s progress and/or complexity in given work is unsatisfactory, then specific corrective actions such as appropriate revisions to the quality management plan, or discussions with supervisors will be done.

## Risk Management Plan

A risk management plan is used to identify and manage project risks as the project goes along. This allows for the estimation of the impact and the probability of them happening, which then enable responses to be defined by the group.

The following are the processes used to identify the project risks.

1. Brainstorming sessions with the group will be used to pick up on common problems that arise in similar group work scenarios done in other courses. 

2. Assumption analysis can be used to identify misconceptions about the project description and requirements as every assumption is a source of potential risk.

The following are the processes used to manage the project risks.

1. Each risk can then be assessed to evaluate the consequence and probability of them.

2. For risks that are unlikely to happen, or where consequences are not severe, preventive measures can be used to potentially avoid them altogether.

3. For each risk that is severe in consequence and likely to happen, a group member will be allocated to create a contingency plan just in case. For example, in order to reduce the potential of data being lost while working on the project, the use of Github allows us to store our work in the cloud, allowing us to access and work on it anywhere, thus providing a safety net if information is lost.

4. Each group member must then keep track of these risks and update it in your project management tool, while making sure other people are aware of what is currently going on and whether there will be changes to the project workflow structure.

## Organisational Structure

The most appropriate organisation structure for the company is one that prioritises the internal cooperation between different divisions. One that fits this description is the flat, team-based structure. This organisational structure benefits greatly from a smaller employee base, in which each employee has increased involvement and responsibility within the organisation. Furthermore, the removal of excess middle layers of management allows for more efficient coordination and communication. Ideas, decisions, and information will travel more quickly and transparently, resulting in more effective responses to clients, as well as tighter feedback loops. Lastly, avoiding a hierarchical structure grants the employees greater creative freedom, which could in turn improve their morale, determination, and performance.

## Staffing Management Plan

The staffing management plan involves the project manager, software programmer, firmware programmer, system integration programmer, test specialist, and technical writer.

The project manager is responsible for the project which includes schedule planning, basic specification formulation, progress tracking, communication and coordination between customers and engineering personnel.

The software programmer is responsible for the system specification, writing the control programming. It also has to cooperate with the firmware programmer and system integration programmer who may provide product improvement methods and alternatives through weekly project meetings.

The firmware programmer is responsible for the signal measurements and the image recognition which the characters will be detected on blocks. It has to cooperate with the software programmer and system integration programmer.

The system integration programmer is responsible for integrating the software and firmware division. It has to communicate between the software engineer and the firmware engineer, and also take responsibility for the whole program process. It will be managed by the project manager and be provided feedback through weekly project meetings after negotiating with customers.

The test specialist is responsible for assisting program tests, guaranteeing the program’s availability, and detecting errors and problems which are neglected by the developer. 

The technical writer is responsible for project documentation which might include the project specification, manual and meeting minutes. It also has to be a communicator between divisions. 

## Communication Management Plan

This project’s communications framework is established by this Communications Management Plan. Throughout the whole project, the CMP will act as a communication guide and it will be modified accordingly when needed. This plan outlines the communication duties of the team members of Mom’s Friendly Robot company and it consists of 2 different parts: Communications Matrix and Communications conduct. Communications Matrix represents the list of stakeholders and describes the different types of communications that the company will be having. In addition, it will also include the frequency, delivery format and deliverables of the various communication types. As for the communications conduct, it illustrates a set of rules and important informations for meetings and other forms of communication. A project team directory is also provided for stakeholders to contact any of the team members. For the whole communication management plan, the project manager will be responsible for keeping the communication productive.

### Communications Conduct

The project manager will provide a schedule for the meetings a week ahead and hence the parties involved would be required to check the schedule beforehand. During the meeting, all phones are required to be in silent mode and all participants are required to be punctual. Meeting minutes will be taken at each meeting and they will be emailed to all participants within 12 hours. For participants of the meeting that are unable to come to the in-person meetings, an online approach is provided via MS Teams. The meeting link will be provided 3 hours before the meeting starts.

The project manager is required to be included in all emails sent. All emails must have a brief description and it must be written formally with no errors. Most importantly emails must be sent only to project participants according to the communications matrix above.
